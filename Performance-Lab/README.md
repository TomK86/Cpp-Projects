# Performance Lab

This was an assignment for CSCI 2400 - Computer Systems at University of Colorado Boulder (Summer 2014)

The goal of this assignment was to improve the performance of a filter application for bitmap images.  I accomplished this by unrolling loops and replacing unnecessary variables with literals.  Most of the changes I made are within the applyFilter method starting on line 95 of FilterMain.cpp.
